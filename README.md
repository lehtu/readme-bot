# readme-bot

Welcome to the marvelous world of **readme-bot**—the software tool that thinks it can whip up a README.md file for you without breaking a sweat! Spoiler alert: it probably can, and it doesn’t even bother to take coffee breaks like we do.

## What is readme-bot?

It's a polite little piece of software that uses the OpenAI API (its younger, more ambitious cousin) to peruse your files and create a README.md file based on them. Because writing a README should *definitely* not take more than a couple of hours of toggling between your editor and countless examples online.

## How does it work?

1. It fetches the list of files in your repository using Git. Apparently, using `git ls-files` is easier than reading the `MANIFEST` list—who knew?
2. Prefers you tell it what files to look at, because it doesn't want to read the code itself. (Not that it can complain; it’s just lines of code.)
3. Creates a README.md vying to be more eloquent than a 80-year-old software developer on a caffeine high.
4. Saves its masterpiece in your project directory because it has your back... if only it had arms to carry it.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the latest version, please) and then:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd readme-bot
npm install
```

Oh, and don’t forget to set up your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. I would tell you how, but it sure sounds tedious.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Usage

Run the readme-bot with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Sit back and watch as it rummages through your files like an uninvited guest at a party, crafting a README.md that may or may not improve the project—much like the last update you pushed at 3 AM.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Open an issue, fork the repo, and submit a pull request—who knows, maybe it’ll be the first thing of mine that I stare at for longer than two seconds without feeling a sudden urge to close the tab.

## License

This project is licensed under the ISC License—because apparently, licenses that sound like something you’d find at a flea market are all the rage now.

And there you have it folks! Your very own README.md, crafted by someone who probably survived one too many late nights debugging and lives to grumble about the simplicity of it all. Now go on, run it, and may the README generation forces be with you!
